    <string name="BBQ_Chicken_Pizza">If you love BBQ chicken and you love pizza, why not put them together? This has long been a cult favorite of sports fans and college kids. The chicken slathered over the top of a pie gives it a tangy, sweet flavor that can’t be beaten.</string>

    <string name="Supreme_Pizza">When you can’t decide which toppings to get, it’s time for the supreme pizza.
